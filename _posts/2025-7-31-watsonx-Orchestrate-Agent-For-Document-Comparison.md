## Introduction

This short series of articles provides an introduction to the latest incarnation of watsonx Orchestrate, which has recently been redesigned for all new deployments from July 2025.

[watson Orchestrate Introduction] covers the key components for building an agent, including defining the agent's purpose, knowledge, tools, flows and behaviour.

[watson Orchestrate Agent Development Toolkit] explains how to install a development environment for local agent development and testing.

This post provides an end to end example of building an agent with tools.

Finally, [watson Orchestrate Publish from ADK to SaaS] shows how to publish a locally developed agent to a watson Orchestrate SaaS tenant, and how users can interact with it.
